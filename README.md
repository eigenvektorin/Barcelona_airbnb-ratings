## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I analysed data from Airbnb listings for Barcelona. The project aims at addressing the following business questions, by following the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM):

* Are there neighbourhoods that are more likely to have higher ratings than others?
* What impact does the price of accommodation have on ratings?
* What other factors can affect the ratings?

This repository contains the following files:
* listings.csv: detailed listings data for Barcelona that can be retreived from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/)
